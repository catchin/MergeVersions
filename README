WHAT FOR?

This plugin searches through the existing F-Spot database for orphaned versions
of photos, i.e. photos that should be versions of other photos but are separate
photos.
E.g.:
2008/11/06/img_2333.jpg
2008/11/06/img_2333 (Modified).jpg
appear as two separate pictures, but the "Modified" one should actually be a
version of the first one.

The MergeVersions plugin searches for pictures named "[name] (Modified).jpg",
"[name] (Modified (2)).jpg" and so on (up to #4) and merges them as versions
into a photo called "[name].jpg" if it exists.


INSTALLATION

* Be sure to have F-Spot installed.
