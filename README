MergeVersions F-Spot Extension
==============================

WHAT FOR?

This plugin searches through the existing F-Spot database for orphaned versions
of photos, i.e. photos that should be versions of other photos but are separate
photos.
E.g.:
2008/11/06/img_2333.jpg
2008/11/06/img_2333 (Modified).jpg
appear as two separate pictures, but the "Modified" one should actually be a
version of the first one.

The MergeVersions plugin searches for pictures named 
"[name] ([version-name]).[ext]" and merges them as versions into a photo called 
"[name].[ext]" if it exists. Also the dates of these two photos are compared.
If they differs, the two photos are not merged.
